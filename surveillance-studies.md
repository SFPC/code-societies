# Surveillance Studies

**Co-Instructors: American Artist and Simone Browne**

<br>

This class grappled with the surveillance of Black life – the archive of slavery, predictive policing, biometric technologies, direct-to-consumer DNA testing kits – in order to understand and also create acts of refusal. Taking hope as a method of refusal, the class questioned various ways of challenging and resisting surveillance.
