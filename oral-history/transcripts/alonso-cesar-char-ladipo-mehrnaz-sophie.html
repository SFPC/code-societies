        <h3>
          So we’ve all had a pretty packed three days. I’d say, the last three days have been pretty intense in terms of the content of the classes. Can any of you describe to me how that’s felt?
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Sophie</h3>
        <p>
          When I arrived at Soft Surplus today, I connected with actually one of its founders and we were talking about how we were similarly in this place of incredible consumption and this sort of image of sediment came up between us where—learning and sort of knowledge production felt like we were building up all these layers that ultimately would form some sort of terrain, which I thought was a really beautiful image because I feel like each workshop class has been so focused and has shaped and and sort of reshaped and carved out new possibilities.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Mehrnaz</h3>
        <p>
          There’s one part for me which yeah, the last three days have been overwhelming and heavy. When I go home, I’m just so hyper from all the thoughts and I end up staying up all night and thinking about it [...] [--] but then there’s another part of me that’s almost relieved like it’s released, like we’ve discussed it and put it out in the open cause it’s conversations that don’t normally happen—that definitely doesn’t happen within my family, within my friend circles too, but to have all these people, who at the very least are open to listening about everyone’s input, it’s been really relieving to know that that’s a possibility, but heavy, yeah.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Char</h3>
        <p>
          I feel like this was needed for a long time, because I’ve had a lot of questions and I feel like they’re getting answered. Although at the moment, I feel very thick and I still have to learn from it. So, yeah.
        </p>

        Hi, Neta again and we had paused previously because Ladipo just joined us and I’d like to give him an opportunity to introduce himself.
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Ladipo</h3>
        <p>
          Thank you, Neta. I’m Ladipo Famoudu. Pronouns he/him/his. And I’m a researcher, artist and futurist in between jobs at the moment, but living in Chicago, happy to be in New York for this program, and yeah.

        <h3>Char</h3>
        <p>
          So, we were talking about the intensity of the past three days that, uh we’ve been experiencing and last we left off, I said I was feeling thick and I wanted to say that the reason I said that is cause I feel like I had a lot of questions answered and it’s going to take me a while for it to absorb into it, like I’m a thick layer of soil [laughter] and seeds are growing down their roots into it—and I’m just digesting it.

        <h3>Char</h3>
        <p>
          I've been thinking a lot about how there is strength in humor and a lot of times, um I think a big realization in my life I like have like many people around us, a lot of anxiety and I think, um, something a big realization for me in my life was learning to make myself laugh and figuring out what makes me laugh helps me get through you know, get through it—and I feel like that also helps—and I see that helping on like a bigger scale—sometimes, you know, it's like when Ruha showed that video—who also showed that video?

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Everyone</h3>
        <p>
          Simone! [Laughter]

      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Char</h3>
        <p>
          Simone, I was like, 'yes!' With that video that it's like it's it's using humor to talk about this like, super dense issue and it's like sometimes humor it is like making yeah [--] And that was something that we were also experienced. I was like, 'what if the thing we made was like, a rock' instead of technology?
