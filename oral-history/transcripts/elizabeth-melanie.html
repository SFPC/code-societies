        <h3>
          Hi, my name is Neta Bomani, and I'm here at the School for Poetic Computation in Manhattan, New York. And we're at 155 Bank Street and I'm here with Melanie Hoff and Elizabeth Perez. And I just wanted to open it up to them to introduce themselves as a part of this Code Societies oral history project.

        <h3>Elizabeth</h3>
        <p>
          As Neta said, my name is Elizabeth Perez. And if I were to use one word to describe myself right now, I would say I am tired. But I'm looking forward to what this conversation will be.
        </p>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Melanie</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Melanie Hoff. I have a tightness in my chest [laughs]. I'm grateful that I got sick on the long weekend of Code Societies. I think that was on purpose. I'm, yeah, really excited to be almost nearing the end of the third session of Code Societies and really excited for the showcase. I keep thinking about it.
        </p>

      <div class="interviewer">
        <h3>
          So what drew you together to have this conversation today?
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Elizabeth</h3>
        <p>
          I think that's gonna be you to answer that one.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Melanie</h3>
        <p>
          Um, I've been thinking a lot about sex as it relates to reproduction. And as soon as I saw Elizabeth application as a birth worker, I knew I wanted to talk to you. I think that, um yeah. Birthing is so powerful and the industry around it is often so horrible [laughs]. And that doulas are like coming in to that, um really dark space and like finding light in it again and, um taking what was always there's to begin with back. It's really inspiring to me and yeah, I just wanted to talk to someone who'd really been there.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Elizabeth</h3>
        <p>
          Yeah. Um, I mean, I think when I [clears throat]—it's complicated, because, you know, often when I share that I am a doula, or I do you know, birth work there's—I feel kind of like a celebrity or famous in many ways, and I'm just like, 'please no cameras,' like leave me alone! Partly because, um, the work I do is not glamorous, um. The work I do is necessary and it doesn't necessarily mean that I want to do it, but I know that it needs to be done, um. So I have a lot of conflicting feelings about it, um. Mostly my favorite part is when I meet new families that are excited about what's happening, um, to their bodies, um but are also like, terrified, like legit terrified of what this means to their lives.
          <br>
          And so I come in there to walk them through it. Um. And it just is a really sensitive, but creative space to be because a lot of—in a lot of ways I can like guide that ship, you know? Um [...] yeah. And so now a lot of, kind of where I'm transitioning into more is, um, as a childbirth educator, so I teach. I teach in Greenpoint, um and then here and there I teach at a studio in Soho. Um, not often, um but I am teaching once a month, like a really long class in Greenpoint, and then two or three workshops throughout the month at that same place in Greenpoint, and just last night, I taught a breastfeeding and newborn care workshop. And, you know, I asked one of the questions I asked her when people introduce themselves as if they know if they were breastfed, and if they were, if they were breastfed, if they know for how long and for a lot of people, they either weren't breastfed, or they were breastfed, but they don't know for how long. And then, you know, when I close the class, and after we've talked about everything I say, 'okay, now if your parent was—is alive is alive still, and you can ask them for how long you were breastfed, or if you were breastfed, now that you have this information, it's probably a good idea.' Because in many ways to do something like breastfeed, um or provide milk for your baby—human milk for your baby is really like it's a counterculture thing to do. Because it's not what we are told to do, in many ways, it's in the way it's really hard to do especially if you never seen someone do it or know of people in your family who are doing it, but it freaks people the fuck out to think that this is another thing that they have to do. And like, because it's a baby, a baby has to eat, and like you have to give baby the best. [Laughter] And just make sure that they are alive, um so I have to be like, really sensitive to that. And um, you know, yeah, it's a real—it's a really vulnerable time. But I like it. I like that—I like the teaching a lot.
        </p>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Melanie</h3>
        <p>
          I think that's part of what makes me so interested in it that you're teaching people such like sacred information that they should sort of already—like a society should be teaching them this, not like a boutique in Greenpoint [laughs] um, and that when, but but that you are teaching them this and then they're learning these things about their own bodies and their own families is like, just so valuable, so beautiful. Uh, I think I get a, like a very shimmer of that feeling when I teach people to think and have different kinds of relationships with the devices that they're using all the time, with the computation that surrounds their life. And I just am like, it just feels so good to teach people a way of refiguring their relationship to something that is so omnipresent that they often feel like they have no control over.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Elizabeth</h3>
        <p>
          And that's exact—like child birth. [Laughs]
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Melanie</h3>
        <p>
          Yeah. [Laughs] and um, yeah, I think that, yeah guess it's some somewhat similar in that um people feel like they don't have control over the computation that designs their life, and that is by design. And people don't know, their own bodies and their own maternal health and family Health for the similar reason by design that that knowledge was like sequestered and taken by similar groups of people—
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Elizabeth</h3>
        <p>
          to the point where the World Health Organization, which is like a huge governing body that many nations should be listening to and implementing the protocols and policies that they recommend, um have these, I guess you can call them, um, yeah, recommendations to protect breastfeeding. And like this is like, recent like within the last anywhere from like, the last five to 20 years, every every so often. There's like new things and so, one of them being like in a hospital plain and simple, like you cannot give out formula packets, but hospitals are doing that, they're sending formula, shipping it to people's homes and how do they know that this person's pregnant? Insurance. And so it's all a fucking business, right? Um. I just want to go back to when you're saying that, like our society should be teaching that, I—I agree in this is probably why I get so pissed off being a doula because like, I don't really want to be a doula, like it's a bandaid like it shouldn't be like your best friend should know what the fuck's going on and how to be like there for you in that moment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Melanie</h3>
        <p>
          Yeah, yeah.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Elizabeth</h3>
        <p>
          Families, like so many people in this city don't have anyone [...] Or just battle better hospital practices. It sucks that there's this idea of like for me to I was I was talking to people this weekend. So on top of teaching, I was interviewing for another client too. And I was like, honestly—and I was like really frank. Like, this is who I am. Like, that's like one of the benefits of working for myself in this particular field is that I don't have to hide what I think and like, if you hire me, you're hiring me because of how I think. And in many ways, it was like, you know, being a doula is, um, I'm in the field of harm reduction, and to ensure, again, that you come out of this as least traumatized as possible, and that we can view the day that your child is born as an actual birthday, the day that you give birth to your child as your birthing day, and that it's like joyful and not like, I just don't know what to—you know, it's like, it's really, it's really intense for a lot of people I got it, you know, either through because of their bodies doing this or because of they don't trust their care provider. Or they don't trust the hospital system. Um and that's where we're going to have our babies in, right? Um yeah, it makes me really sad because I feel like I have to carry this weight on me and I'm like, I don't want to do that. I want to like—I want to be able to start living my life and be able to attend births because I want them not because it's my occupation. And that's not to say that I don't like my clients I'm getting to choose them, but I do feel this pressure of like having to continue this work because there's only such a small percentage of people that are actually using birth doulas in their life or even postpartum doula work—so many times I come once they've had their baby and I might have not been their birth doula and it is like crisis management like, 'crisis averted, crisis averted,' or like, you know, maybe we should call a doctor or maybe this baby should see a pediatrician. You know? Um. It's kind of wild sometimes where I'm just like, we don't have anyone, a lot of people don't have people. And that's like, the saddest part of it that, you know, my doula partner is a fantastic human being and she she always says this, she's like it feels like a really alone, isolating experience, but imagine if there was a light bulb that goes off on every apartment or building for two, three in the morning when someone's like, in the throes of nursing the first two weeks of a baby's life and you just don't know what's going on, and you'd have to change this baby's diaper. That's a lot of light bulbs that are on, but it feels like no one's there with you, you know, so. And because—I think part of me being so exhausted is because I'm giving so much, I'm giving so much of my confidence to someone else. Because there's this there's just not any there's just not any confidence or assurance that this is the right decision. Like this is a good decision. There's a lot of fear in having a baby for many reasons and they're valid. Absolutely. But it's not like people are not going to not have babies, people are going to have babies. And it's something that I think about because I have a three year old, um. The type of world that we're in right now and the type of world we're going to have. And so I often share with them—I was like, well, you decided to keep this pregnancy and go through with it and have this baby and you're making such a big investment by being in this class and hiring a doula or whatever, whatever it is that you think that you need to do to be prepared that the goal is, the goal is always to make a wonderful, compassionate, creative, kind, centered child, so that my son can have that homie to play with [laughter], because why else would we be doing this? Like, we want good people to be part of this, you know, so that makes them laugh and kind of reminds them 'okay, oh-kay, like that's, that's gonna be fun. That's gonna be hard, but it's gonna be fun,' you know? Sometimes taking the mind off of like, the immediacy of it because it's such a short time. And it's literally right there. But once the baby's here, that's forever. I want to focus on that more.

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Melanie</h3>
        <p>
          Mhm. Hm. A lot of things that you said made me think of things—I was thinking about like, how alone  you were saying the women feel or the birth—birth people, who are pregnant—
        </p>
      </div>


      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Elizabeth</h3>
        <p>
          you can say birthing people—
        </p>
      </div>


      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Melanie</h3>
        <p>
          birthing people feel when—and that reminds me that there's like some theories of gender or theories of origin of patriarchy is that because women were carrying the babies and then thus had like a lot of inherent power that is impossible to take or argue otherwise, that they are—play a very big role in bringing new people into the world. Um, that that, that patriarchy was invented just to try to take that power away and that—that we can see that very in like the most clear ways and the ways that people are not educated and don't feel supported in their pregnancy and that they feel like this is like a almost something like, 'I have a disease' or something because there's just such a lack of information and then the, the processes that that birthing people go through when they are in labor, when they are giving birth are so cold and so distant from any—from like, the power that they are harnessing by growing another person. That's just so, just so, um, there's just so much conflict there so much tension in the, in the contrast of like what you're doing and the the platforms available to support you, yeah.

      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Elizabeth</h3>
        <p>
          And it's like literally the beginning.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Melanie</h3>
        <p>
          Yeah.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Elizabeth</h3>
        <p>
          That is the true genesis.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Melanie</h3>
        <p>
          Yeah.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="narrator">
        <h3>Elizabeth</h3>
        <p>
          Every single time no matter how many children you have, each time is a new time. And [... ]another thing I always say is like, Melanie, if your mom is sad, over you when you were a child, especially if your mom was sad, how did you feel? If you saw her anything, but smiling? Or you, Neta. Y'all were fucked up?
