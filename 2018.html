        <strong>Lauren McCarthy taught <a href="https://github.com/lmccart/Smarter-Home">Smarter Home</a></strong>
        We will explore home as a place, as an identity, as a practice, and as a series
        of rituals. What makes someone feel "at home" in a space or in a community (both
        in person and online)? We will investigate the meaning of home as private space.
        What happens when networked technologies are brought into this? What roles do
        surveillance, data collection, automation, and telepresence play? But what is
        our ideal home of the future? As a class, we will build a smart home on our
        terms, with each person contributing a device, gesture, piece of furniture,
        ritual, etc of their design to create an installation throughout sfpc's space.

        <strong>Allison Parrish taught <a href="https://gist.github.com/aparrish/84067a801d840ceef190053cec1266e7">Authoring text under control: from automatic writing to autocomplete</a></strong>
        "Automatic writing" refers to a process in which an author produces writing
        effortlessly, without apparent conscious awareness. Psychologists study
        automatic writing to better understand how mind affects muscle; creative writers
        use it to circumvent writer's block; surrealists practice it to recover a
        repressed primal consciousness; spiritualists use it to communicate with the
        dead. This series of workshops attempts to make explicit the technical and
        conceptual connections between these varied practices and computer-generated
        text, considering technologies like spell check, autocomplete, and search
        suggestions to themselves qualify as ""automatic writing."" Using the Python
        programming language, students will learn a series of techniques for producing
        text ""automatically"" with computer programs and design interfaces for
        ""writing"" with these programs. We'll discuss the nature of text and authorship
        in a future where technology increasingly mediates the act of writing itself.

        <strong>Sarah Aoun taught <a href="https://gist.github.com/saoun/5465ce56b684f463d136ba0e863c3cf8">Diversity &amp; Inclusion in Surveillance AI</a></strong>
        Facial recognition and diversity have not gone together seamlessly. On the one
        hand, despite the popular rise of facial recognition technology over the past
        several years, we have witnessed the exclusion of people of color from the
        design and implementation process. Facial recognition tools are often
        discriminatory, and time after time, softwares either fail to recognize people
        of color or mislabel them. On the other hand, facial recognition technology is
        also one that is increasingly integrated into police and state surveillance
        tools. Addressing these tensions, this class will explore tools of surveillance
        and whom they target, the social and political implications of AI development,
        and the unintended effects that diversity and inclusion might have.

        <strong>American Artist taught <a href="https://github.com/0ld-h3ad/SFPC-code-societies">Software as Ideology</a></strong>
        Expanding on Wendy Hui Kyong Chun’s theory of software as an analogy for
        ideology, we will look in depth at Alexander Galloway’s take on the idea, which
        contrasts a historical overview of ideology with a contemporary description of
        software, to reveal where these two interfacing methods of society overlap. We
        will discuss how software became distinct from hardware, the presumption of
        programmers as different from users, and how obfuscation is an essential tool of
        software development as well as ideology.

        <strong>Melanie Hoff &amp; Dan Taeyoung taught <a href="https://github.com/smalldatasquad/social-network-paintings">Social Network Paintings</a></strong>
        <br>What is the self-portrait of a society?
        <br>On social media, you are an individual who forms relationships with other individuals. You follow, link, like, subscribe.
        A model of a social network understands society as a series of interconnected networks, graphs, spider webs. Individuals are circular nodes, relationships are lines or edges, and networks are portrayed as linkages between nodes. With a social network, the data is the message: both a visual representation, and a database structure.
        Embedded in this node-and-edge paradigm is an underlying presumption that humans are individuals first, and that society, groups, and cultures then arise as result of individual groupings: That society is, supposedly, <em>what emerges when you connect a group of individuals.</em>
        <br>But is this really the case? We pay attention to what our closest friends pay attention to. We adopt the habits of our loved ones. We are affected by people, forces, and ecologies we’ve never known. We are beings formed by our societies, our systems, our cultures.
        <br>Social Network Paintings is an exploration of the most common representations of social networks and the ways the database as form has influenced these representations. We will get our hands dirty with paint and software to make and remake social networks and societies. What are the conceptual assumptions and gaps in the network-form? How can these forms be misused, reappropriated, and decontextualized to represent other modes of experience? How can painting, poetry, and performance be a models for representing our societies?

        <strong>Shannon Mattern taught <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1riZTAquDnjMzM_gHm3gZobxnuitBwAEXaX68AhLTKNY/edit?usp=sharing">Sorting Things Out: Classifications, Ontologies, Data Models, Knowledge Graphs</a></strong>
        We sort things into piles, put things onto shelves, build folders on desktops,
        and check boxes on forms that identify (or approximate) our gender, race, and,
        citizenship. Such sorting not only helps to reduce clutter; it also, often,
        determines what counts, imposes an implied valuation, and informs access to
        opportunity. In these two sessions of “Code Societies,” we’ll examine how the
        construction of classification systems, ontologies, data models, and knowledge
        graphs serves to translate between worldviews, way of knowing, ideologies, and
        modes of governance. In some cases, we might say that these organizational
        systems, encoded in computational form, code particular societies into being.
        How might we develop aspirational ontologies that help us to imagine more just,
        inclusive, peaceful societies?

        <strong>Taeyoon Choi taught <a href="https://github.com/tchoi8/distributedwebofcare/tree/codesocieties">Distributed Web of Care</a></strong>
        Distributed Web of Care is an initiative to code to care and code carefully. In
        this class, we will investigate centralized, decentralized, distributed and peer
        to peer networks. We will analyze the popular platforms such as Instagram and
        technical platforms such as GitHub, focusing on the network structure and
        protocols. We will experiment with strings and stickers to visualize and embody
        different types of network. We will imagine the kinds of network we want for the
        future and we will discuss how we can build it with code and code of conduct. We
        will distribute our work (poetry, code, or something else) over distributed
        network using Beaker browser.
