<em> can a spell be as simple as a piece of tape over the webcam? i think that in this space we have concantenated (i don't know if i used that word right and there's no spell-check when youre writing code) but anyway i think we have concantenated something even more powerful: a network of community care and solidarity. as char jere put it one class -- talking to your neighbors is a kind of magic. we have shared so many connections contra the unsavory wills of the powers that be. creating ritual: perhaps we start a signal group chat? staying connected is the medicine.</em>

    <blockquote>
      asking hard questions is magic. to ask is to imply answers are possible. if we believe answers are possible, weâ€™re much more likely to find them â€“ to find the capacity within ourselves to propose new ways of being in relation with each other.
