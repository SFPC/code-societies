          <p><em>üçÉThe computer, the programmer, the relationship they have with each other, and the environments they createüçÉ</em></p>

          <p>A one-session class covering the primary computational methods of Code Societies Classes: Winter 2019. Together we will defamiliarize and refamiliarize ourselves with the Command Line Interface, Git/Github, running Python 3 in the terminal, &amp; running Python 3 with Anaconda Jupyter Notebook. We will navigate folder structure narratives with the command line, time travel with Git, code socially with Github, and process language with Python.</p>

            <li>Unzip the folder and move it into to your ‚Äúhome‚Äù or ‚Äúroot‚Äù folder (the one with the little house icon on a Mac).</li>
          </ul>

        <h5 id="we-can-think-of-the-environment-as-way-that-a-programmer-builds-their-personal-workflow-in-the-domain-of-their-computer">üåøWe can think of the ‚Äúenvironment‚Äù as way that a programmer builds their personal workflow in the domain of their computer‚Ä¶</h5>
        <blockquote>
          Coding isn‚Äôt something that just happens in your text editor or terminal. Coding can be a wholistic computer practice, a new relationship you have with your computer &amp; your computer habits. from the way you name your files or organize your folders, to completely changing how you perform routine tasks on your computer such as moving a file.
        </blockquote>

        <p>To ensure that you can easily access Atom (the text editor we will be using throughout this guide) follow these steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Open Atom</li>
          <li>Click the Atom menu in the top left corner and choose ‚Äúinstall shell commands‚Äù. This will ensure that you can access Atom from the Terminal also known as the <em>command line</em>.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><img src="http://sfpc.io/codesocieties-winter-19/assets/computational-methods-1.jpg" alt="Computational Methods of Code Societes: Terminal example"></p>

        <h5 id="what-is-the-command-line">üåøWhat is the command line?</h5>
        <p>Think about all of the applications you open on a day to day basis on your computer. One of the many mechanisms we use to do these things is dragging and clicking different icons and folders using a mouse or trackpad.</p>

        <p>Let‚Äôs take a small tour of our computers by following these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open up a new Finder window.</li>
          <li>Navigate to your home folder. It is helpful to use the ‚Äúfolder view‚Äù, you can do this by clicking the little icon with the three rectangles at the top of the Finder window.</li>
          <li>Click on the code-societies folder</li>
          <li>Notice that there are two folders inside of that folder</li>
          <li>Now click on the computational-methods-code-societies folder</li>
          <li>Notice that there is a folder called house</li>
          <li>If you click on house you will notice a few more folders denoting the rooms in the house</li>
          <li>Keep going!</li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote>
          This folder structure follows the structure of a house which is a spatial metaphor for how we navigate folders on our computer. For example, when you‚Äôre in a house and standing in the kitchen and you wanted to go to bed you would need to navigate from the kitchen into your bedroom before you actually tried to lay down.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Another way to do this kind of navigation is by using the command line, a text-based mechanism for doing the same kind of navigation between folders and files.</p>

        <p>The command line can be seen a more intimate way to interact with your computer, it‚Äôs kind of like having a conversation, you can ask your computer to do something and it might respond to you with a confirmation of what you typed or some kind of prompt or a scrolling list of crazy words letting you know that it is in the process of installing some stuff or nothing at all!</p>

        <blockquote>
          sometimes you will ask your computer to install something and it will not give you any kind of response but the thing you wanted to install was actually successful. the reason the computer will not return any kind of response takes us way back into the history of computing when the computer would respond to a programmer by printing out its response on a piece of paper. In order to save paper computers were programmed to just do nothing if the command was successful.
        </blockquote>

        <p><img src="http://sfpc.io/codesocieties-winter-19/assets/computational-methods-3.jpg" alt="Computational Methods of Code Societes: Terminal magic, photo of someone's Terminal garden"></p>

        <h5 id="lets-embark-on-a-folder-structure-narrative-">üåøLets embark on a Folder Structure Narrative !</h5>

        <blockquote>
          Moving forward you can think of the Terminal (command line) as the ‚Äúsecret trap door/master key/teleportation portal‚Äù to your computer.
        </blockquote>

        <p>The programming language of the terminal is called Bash. This is the language that allows us to write commands that the Terminal can understand so that we can do things like navigate the file system (as we did above) on our computers. Bash files, also known as scripts because they often execute pieces of code, look something like this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name-of-bash-script.sh</code></p>

        <p>Follow these steps to begin:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Press command and spacebar</li>
          <li>Type in ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù</li>
          <li>Press Enter</li>
          <li>When you open the Terminal you‚Äôll see something called a bash prompt: You‚Äôll see your user name and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> represents your home directory.</li>
          <li>You can verify that you‚Äôre in the home directory by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> and pressing enter. You should see a list of all of the folders and files directly inside of your home directory.</li>
          <li>You change directories from your home directory by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> and pressing enter.</li>
          <li>If you type in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd code-societies</code> your bash prompt will now look something like this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">your username:code-societies$</code></li>
          <li>Remember you can verify that you‚Äôre in the a particular directory by looking at your bash prompt as well as by running the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command. With the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command you should see all of the folders and files inside the directory you are currently in.</li>
          <li>From the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code-socities</code> folder you can cd into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">computational-methods-code-societies</code></li>
          <li>Finally you can cd in the house folder.</li>
          <li>Welcome to the house tour! Lets <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kitchen</code>!</li>
          <li>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>. Do you see the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pots-and-pans.txt</code> ?</li>
          <li>Try running this command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat pots-and-pans.txt</code></li>
          <li>This <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code> command will display all of contents of that file right inside your terminal ! How beautiful !</li>
          <li>Now you lets <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">garden</code></li>
          <li>Run ls again and notice a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grow.sh</code>. We know this is a bash script because of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sh</code>. This means that we can execute this script (or program) inside of terminal.</li>
          <li>To see the bash script in action type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash grow.sh</code> and press enter. A bunch of beautiful flowers should appear!</li>
          <li>Notice if you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat grow.sh</code> you will see the contents of the script that produced the bunch of beautiful flowers!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The commands we‚Äôve learned so far are:
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code>
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code></p>

        <p>Some more helpful commands:
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open .</code>
            opens the folder you are currently inside of
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ..</code>
            changes directories in reverse
        tab key to autocomplete
        up and down arrow keys
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">touch</code>
            creates a new file
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atom .</code>
            opens the folder you are currently inside of with Atom
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code>
            makes a new directory
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">touch myfile.txt</code>
            creates a new file called myfile.txt
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm foldername</code>
            removes a folder called foldername
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm filename.txt</code>
            removes a file called filename.txt
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">say</code>
            asks your terminal to say whatever you have types</p>

        <blockquote>
          If you try to run cat on a jpg file the terminal will print out all of the ‚Äútext‚Äù for the file.

          Example of artist, Ryan Kuo who used navigating a generic looking Mac Application to talk about navigating family dynamics in his piece, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ra6gl7hakv4n3qg/Screenshot%202019-01-08%2013.34.51.png?dl=0">Family Maker</a>
        </blockquote>

        <ol>
          <li>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ..</code> as many times as you need until your bash prompt tells you that you are inside of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">computational-methods-code-societies</code> folder</li>
          <li>We will use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code> command to create some new folders. mkdir stands for make directory. For example, you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir my-new-folder</code> and that folder will be created inside of your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">computational-methods-code-societies directory</code>.</li>
          <li>Use the touch command to create new files within the folders. It is helpful to make sure that the names of your folders and files do not have spaces or capital letters</li>
          <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd name-of-folder</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ..</code> to move in and out of folders</li>
          <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm -rf name-of-folder-or-file</code> (remove recursive force) to delete items but be careful you can‚Äôt undo this!</li>
          <li>If you see a bash command and you want to know exactly what it does you can use the man command, for example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man ls</code> will show you what ls stands for. You can press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">q</code> to exit the explanation.</li>
          <li>If you want to see hidden files (files that start with a dot) within a directory you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -AF</code></li>
          <li>You can run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clear</code> command to refresh your terminal window.</li>
        </ol>

          <li>Take a look at your partner‚Äôs invented Folder Structure Narrative from earlier in class.</li>
          <li>Using terminal, build on top of what your partner was going for with their narrative.</li>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add .</code></li>

        <h5 id="python">üåøPython</h5>
        <p>There are a lot of different ways to interact with Python. One way is using the interactive interpreter. Another way is using Jupyter Notebooks. In this guide we will mostly be working within a Jupyter Notebook.</p>

        <h5 id="to-ensure-that-python-is-installed">To ensure that Python is installed:</h5>
        <p>Type word python and press enter you should get back something like this Python 3.7.1 (default, Dec 14 2018, 13:28:58)[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] ::</p>

        <h5 id="python-terminology--conventions">Python terminology + conventions</h4>
        <p>In terminal you can write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print(hello world)</code> and the terminal will print out the line ‚Äúhello world‚Äù. In Python you will usually write the name of the function, open parentheses, argument, closed parentheses</p>

        <p>Now we will do some more things with Python:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open atom</li>
          <li>Create a new file</li>
          <li>Paste in the following:
         <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sensations = open(‚Äúsensations.txt‚Äù)</code></li>
          <li>Creating a variable that is going to store the information inside sensations.txt. Open is telling my computer to looks for a file called sensations.txt within the directory that you are currently in. Don‚Äôt forget to use quotations for your file name!</li>
          <li>Now add print(sensations)
         This will print out whatever is inside of the variable sensations. Terminal will return:
         <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;_io.TextIOWrapper name='sensations.txt' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'&gt;</code></li>
        </ol>

        <h5 id="loops">Loops</h5>

        <p>In the sensations.txt file add the following lines:</p>

        <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for </span>line <span class="k">in </span>sensations:
        	print<span class="o">(</span>line<span class="o">)</span>
        </code></pre></div></div>

        <p>The sensations.txt file should now look like this:</p>

        <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sensations <span class="o">=</span> open<span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">"sensations.txt"</span><span class="o">)</span>

        <span class="k">for </span>line <span class="k">in </span>sensations:
        	print<span class="o">(</span>line<span class="o">)</span>
        </code></pre></div></div>
        <p>Now you can save the file and go back to the Terminal.</p>

        <p>In the terminal you can write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jupyter notebook</code> and press enter. This will automatically open up a new browser window.</p>

        </ul>

        <p>For example:
        	- <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Traceback (most recent call last)</code> is referring to the most recent place in the code where an error was found
        	- <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Io</code> stands for input ouput</p>
